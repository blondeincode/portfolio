      <description>Hi. My name is Magdalena Bienias. I graduated with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in mathematics at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski University in Warsaw. I am currently in the second year of master&amp;rsquo;s studies in big data management at the University of Warsaw. In the future, I want to deal with data analysis professionally. I have carried out my projects so far as part of my studies or as a hobby. I am looking for an internship that would help me develop in this direction.</description>
